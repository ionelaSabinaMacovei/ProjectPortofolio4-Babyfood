                  From 6 months-old, if you started your baby solid food introduction at the age of 4 months, 
                  your baby now knows a good list of foods and you have concocted amazing recipes!
                  The texture of the puree can now be slightly granular but still quite smooth and easy to swallow for your baby.

                  7-months baby recipes are fun to cook!
                  Your baby will continue drinking milk. 
                  For the quantities of puree, listen to your baby: try to give him a little more as you go but never force your baby to finish his puree. 
                  At this age, baby should eat about 6oz of puree per day, but again it depends on the babies, their size, their weight … always adapt these quantities to your baby.

                  Vegetables will now be crushed, about 6.3oz per day. 
                  The amount of meat or fish will be able to increase also from 0.35oz to 5oz per meal (preferably only for lunch).

                  The fruits can be given raw, finely sliced for your baby to discover new textures. We give 7oz of vegetables for lunchtime with meat, fish or egg. 
                  The egg can also be introduced with the white, hard (1 third of hard egg during lunch, not more than once a week).

                        Our goal here is to publish recipes that you, your family and your friends
                        will not only love but will want to make time and time again. We hope to inspire you as a home
                        cook and boost your confidence in the kitchen. Life is meant to be enjoyed and doesn’t good food
                        just make it more enjoyable? Please follow along and let's create something delicious!</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">We think we have built a good food blog, so naturally, you’re going to find
                        recipes here. But we only share the recipes we really, truly love. You won’t find anything here
                        that we’ve never made before or would never make again. Every recipe we post has our stamp of
                        approval.

                        If we wouldn’t eat it or serve it, you won’t find it here.
                        Step-by-step instructions with photos. When we first started cooking, we were unsure about so
                        many things: How big should we dice the onions? How thick should we cut the vegetables? What
                        should this look like halfway through the recipe when it looks nothing like the final photo?
                        Helpful tips and techniques. We love learning any skill that helps us get the job done faster,
                        easier or with a better result. That’s why we created a page of nothing but useful tips and
                        techniques.

                        Fun! Food and fun come together in this blog because everything about food should be fun: eating
                        it, making it and even making a mess of it.</p>
